# Perth Linux Users Group Statement of Values
As an organisation, we aim to represent and assist the groups and individuals
who make up the Free Software and Open Source communities in Western Australia.
These communities are diverse in many ways, and the groups and individuals which
constitute them have many different needs that should be addressed and supported
to the best of our ability. In doing so, it is our goal to uphold certain values
reflecting the core philosophies around open source technologies. This statement
specifies those values which we aim to embody, embrace and promote as an
organisation.

These values should inform the strategic direction, activities and decision
making of the organisation as a whole.


## Open Technology
Perth Linux Users Group was founded with a focus on the Linux operating system
but quickly evolved to embrace all facets of open technology. Open technology is
a term encompassing openness in source code, standards, formats, licences and
APIs. Whether for software sources, documents, hardware designs, images or works
of art, we value the use of open licenses to promote the creative reuse of
intellectual effort.

Open source makes code available to everyone to study, modify, repurpose and
redistribute. We value the innovation made possible by the sharing of openly
licensed intellectual effort.


## Community
We value the creation, support and maintenance of community around open
technologies. This includes private individuals, community projects, other
aligned organisations and businesses engaged with open technologies.
Communities can be any combination of developers, users or advocates of open
technologies. We invite participation in our communities and culture, and
welcome newcomers.


## Freedom
We value freedom in the use and development of open technologies. This includes
freedom of expression within accepted community norms.

We strongly encourage the use of free software and free culture copyright
licenses.

We value free access to, sharing of and repurposing of information, in
particular that information held by the public sector.


## Respect
We value respect for people, for community, and for society. This includes
respect for the opinions, ideals and choices of others, for the communities
which we create and participate in, and for society as a whole. It is vital
that while we uphold our ideals, we respect the ideals of others. We obey lawful
restrictions placed upon us, particularly with reference to licencing, copyright
and patent law, to the best of our ability.


## Diversity
People of all ages, genders, nationalities, ethnicities, backgrounds, abilities
and walks of life are part of the communities we serve. We respect and encourage
diversity at our conferences, events, and other activities.
